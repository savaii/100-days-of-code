# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 000: 5 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Listened to the CodeNewbie podcast for the first time. 
- Decided that I'm going to learn ruby-on-rails and only focus on that
- Started the #100DaysOfCode challenge

**Thoughts:** I am going to do this for reals this time. I don't want to be in the same career place (read: Salary) a year from now and feel sad. This is going to be the start of a new, more determined, more successful Joe that actually does things and improves himself. I have a new S.M.A.R.T. goal in this 100 days of code challenge so I am going to do it. #NoZeroDays.
